# Warfarin-and-CKD

This project is for the analysis of a research project of Warfarin use in chronic kidney disease patients.

Four tables are produced:
1. Patients Demographics 
2. Baseline Differences between CKD patients and NKF patients 
3. Outcome Differences between CKD patients and NKF patients 
4. Linear regression model about the expected Warfarin dose that maintain the INR at target 

## Investigation Overview

> The research aimed to evaluate the response of chronic kidney disease (CKD) Saudi patients to Warfarin in comparison to patients on Warfarin who have normal kidney functions. 

## Dataset Overview

> The final data-set file included three different excel sheets. The first sheet contained the patients' Characteristics. Warfarin doses and the international normalized ratio (INR) values for each patient were collected into the second sheet. The third sheet included the information about whether or not each patient developed a bleeding (minor or major) or a venous thromboembolism (VTE) event. The data were managed and analysed in Python 3.7.
